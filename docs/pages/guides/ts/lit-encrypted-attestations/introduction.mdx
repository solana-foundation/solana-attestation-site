# Encrypted Attestation Data with Lit Protocol

## Introduction

Solana attestations are typically stored on-chain for transparency and verifiability. However, many real-world use cases require privacy controls over sensitive attestation data such as: medical records, academic transcripts, personal certifications, and proprietary business information.

Lit Protocol solves this challenge by enabling you to encrypt attestation data while maintaining programmable access control. Instead of storing sensitive data directly on-chain, you can store encrypted data that only authorized parties can decrypt based on conditions you define.

This guide shows you how to combine Solana's attestation service with Lit Protocol's decentralized encryption to create private, yet verifiable attestations.

In this section, we'll cover how to integrate Lit Protocol into the [Basic](/guides/ts/how-to-create-digital-credentials) and [Tokenized](/guides/ts/lit-encrypted-attestations/tokenized-attestation-flow) attestation guides.

## How Lit Protocol Works

Lit Protocol is a decentralized key management network that enables secure encryption without requiring users to manage complex cryptographic keys.

### Access Control Conditions (ACCs)

Rules that define who can decrypt your data, for example:

- Specific wallet addresses
- NFT or token ownership requirements
- Time-based conditions
- Custom logic utilizing on and/or off-chain data

### Identity-Based Encryption

Your data is encrypted using a unique identity derived from your ACCs and a hash of the data you're encrypting. When the Lit nodes generation the decryption key, it's generated on-demand specifically for this identity, meaning a decryption key is only valid to decrypt specific data encrypted with the specific ACCs.

### Threshold Network

Lit is powered by a network of nodes running in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) using sealed AMD SEV-SNP hardware that isolates key material from node operators. Your data is encrypted client-side, is never stored on the Lit network, and is not accessible to the Lit nodes.

## The Encryption Process

1. **Define the ACCs**: Specify who and when your attestation data can be decrypted
2. **Encrypt the data**: Use Lit's JavaScript SDK to encrypt your attestation content using the Lit network's BLS public key
3. **Store the encrypted data**: Store the encrypted data on-chain as the Solana attestation

## The Decryption Process

When someone requests to decrypt the attestation data, Lit's network ensures security through a distributed verification process:

1. **Policy verification**: Each Lit node independently verifies that your ACCs are satisfied
2. **Signature share creation**: If the ACCs are met, each node uses its BLS private key share to sign the identity (a combination of your ACCs and the hash of the data you're encrypting), producing a decryption key share
3. **Threshold key shares**: Once a threshold (more than two-thirds) of nodes have provided their key shares, the Lit SDK combines them to construct a full decryption key
4. **Data recovery**: The authorized user uses the reconstructed key to decrypt and access the original attestation data.

This distributed approach means no single node can decrypt your data alone, and decryption only happens when your specified ACCs are completely satisfied.

## Next Steps

This section of the guide is split up into multiple parts:

- **Basic Encrypted Attestations**: Start with wallet-based access control
- **Tokenized Access Control**: Use NFTs or tokens to control attestation access
- **Advanced Conditions**: Combine multiple on-chain and off-chain conditions
